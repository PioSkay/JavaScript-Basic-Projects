### This is the repository with some of my basic projects done using javascipt.
#### Projects:

##### 1. Pig Game
This is the two players game. Each player is supposed to `Roll` a dice until the 1 pops up. In that case all of the current points are lost. Player is also capable of Holding the points, after pressing the `Hold` butotn current points are added to the general points and round ends. First players crossing the 100 points mark wins.
